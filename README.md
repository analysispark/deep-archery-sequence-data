# Archery Motion Analysis Dataset

This repository contains `.npy` data files used in the research titled:

**"Development and Application of a Deep Learning Sequence Network Model for Enhancing Archery Performance"**  
by Jihoon Park (Yongin University) and Hyongjun Choi (Dankook University)

## ðŸ“˜ Description

The dataset includes joint coordinate data extracted from video recordings of four national-level Korean archers. The data was collected using real-time pose estimation techniques and preprocessed for deep learning sequence model training.

Key features:
- 17 joint coordinates per frame, normalized and filtered.
- Sequence data from the "ready" position to "release."
- Used for training RNN, LSTM, GRU, Bi-LSTM, and Bi-GRU models.
- Data sampling at 60 FPS for precision motion analysis.
